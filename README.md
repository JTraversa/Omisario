# Omisario
 A basic integration between the OmiseGo network and Super Mario



In order to run a local version of the game, ensure you have installed the required packages from the packages.json. 

You can do so using:

```
~ npm install package-name
```

After dependencies have been installed, using a command prompt navigate to the directory and execute: 

```
~ node node-app.js
``` 

You can then access the game in any browser by navigating to:

```
http://http://localhost:9001/
```
