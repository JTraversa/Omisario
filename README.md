# Omisario

 A basic integration between the OmiseGo network and Super Mario NES


-------------------------------------------------
This integration is run on the Ropsten Ethereum testnet.

Staying connected to the mainnet will not affect payments or game performance, but all payments are only accessable through the ropsten testnet & ropsten OmiseGo testnet.

--------------------------------------------------

In order to run a local version of the game, ensure you have installed the required packages from the packages.json. 

You can do so using:

```
~ npm install package-name
```

After dependencies have been installed, using a command prompt navigate to the directory and execute: 

```
~ node node-app.js
``` 

You can then access the game in any browser by navigating to:

```
http://http://localhost:9001/
```
