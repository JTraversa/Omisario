 A basic integration between the OmiseGo network and Super Mario



In order to run a local version of the game, ensure you have installed the required packages from the packages.json. You can do so using:

```
~ npm install package-name

```

After dependencies have been installed, using a command prompt navigate to the directory and execute: 


```
~ node node-app.js

```
